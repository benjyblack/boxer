## Players Guide

###Storyline
You are the once renowned (and now dead) heavy-weight championship runner-up Bruce Punchalot.  You have risen from the depth of the Earth so that you may exact revenge on the corrupt National Boxing Federation who rigged the championship match, robbing you of your title and causing you to end your own life.  Your mission?  Kill everyone.  There is a problem however.  Having spent some time among the dead, you awaken to find that your arms are weak and rotten and that your attacks have little effect on your enemies.  As a result you must make use of the various booby traps and environmental hazards present in the NBF headquarters to assist you in dispatching all who stand in your way.

###Objectives
The objective of the game is to exact your revenge by eliminating the entire National Boxing Federation.  To do this you must make your way through their headquarters room by room.  Each door will seal itself behind you, and the door to move forward will only open once you have defeated all of the enemies in the room. An optional objective is to beat the high-score set by the developers. The highest scores are those earned by using multiple trap-power combinations. For instance if you sludge an enemy and then oil-slick them into a laser beam you will “Sloil Beam” them and you will get 5 credits as opposed to the single credit you would have earned from simply Laser Beam-ing them. The more you experiment the more combinations you will find and the higher scores you will be able to obtain.
